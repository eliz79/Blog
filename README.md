MY BLOG 
by Erica Liz

A SIMPLE BLOG

The following blog was created by using Python along with some Flask,
HTML and CSS, and some SQLite3 for database usage. The blog ulitlizes
several controllers methods such as login and logout. The controllers 
will check if a correct sername and password were entered correctly, 
if not then it will flash an error message to try again. Once a user
is logged in a user can try a few things. With the help of HTML coding
I was able to allow users to download a Word document for a recipe. As 
well users can read posts.If a user wants to leave a message they can 
by clicking anoher controller for leaving messages. AS well they can 
clear messages.
